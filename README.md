# Description

Application takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

User is prompted for information about the team members, starting with the manager. After the manager info has been entered, user needs to choose from a list of options to add Engineer, Intern or that they don't want to add any more members. If the user chooses the last, that they don't want to add any more members, HTML is generated.
